# EDA--Car-Sales-Dataset
This project explores a used car sales dataset to analyze factors influencing resale value, identify trends in the second-hand car market, and understand buyer behavior.

This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of used car listings, aiming to uncover insights into the **second-hand car market**, understand **resale value trends**, and observe **consumer behavior** based on vehicle features.

---

## 📌 Source

The dataset is available on **Kaggle** and represents data commonly found on online car resale platforms.  
🔗 *[Add Kaggle dataset link here]*

---

## 📄 Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed information about used cars listed for sale, including:

- `Brand` – Manufacturer of the car  
- `Model` – Specific car model  
- `Year` – Year of manufacture or registration  
- `Selling_Price` – Resale price of the car  
- `Kilometers_Driven` – Total distance driven  
- `Fuel_Type` – Type of fuel (Petrol, Diesel, etc.)  
- `Transmission` – Manual or Automatic  
- `Owner` – Ownership history (First, Second, etc.)

This data can be used for **predictive modeling**, **trend analysis**, and exploring **customer preferences** in the used car market.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand key factors influencing **resale value**
- Analyze **trends and patterns** in the second-hand car market
- Visualize **relationships** between different vehicle features
- Clean and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis

## 🧪 Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns
   - Converting data types

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution of prices, kilometers driven, and fuel types

3. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
   - How features like brand, transmission, fuel type, and ownership affect resale price

4. **Visualization**
   - Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and heatmaps to uncover trends

5. **Insights & Observations**
   - Summarized key findings based on the data

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Diesel cars tend to have higher resale value in some segments.
- First-owner cars command significantly better prices.
- Manual cars are more common, but automatics are gaining popularity in newer models.
- Certain brands retain value better than others over time.
